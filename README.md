# Traffic


[![Build Status](https://github.com/open-fsm/traffic/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/open-fsm/traffic/actions)


Traffic provides a point-to-point communication model, which mainly solves the complex network problems between nodes in a distributed environment. Users can customize functions according to their actual scenarios.

As a network solution for the vr protocol, we use rpc to implement traffic.
